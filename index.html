    <p>My phone screen displayed a call from Damascus, Syria, below a phone number that I recognized as my grandmother&rsquo;s. I picked up the call and we proceeded to our regular conversational routine that we had practiced since I could speak: exchanging hellos, showering compliments on each other and asking for news.</p>

    <p>These past few years had presented an obstacle to the routine. My grandmother, Isa&rsquo;af Ali, was in the middle of the Syrian civil war.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How is your day, nanaj?&rdquo; I asked my grandma in Circassian.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The day is going well. There is music playing outside, the tomatoes in the market were ripe and the neighbors dropped by and said hello,&rdquo; my nanaj answered.</p>

    <p>My heart began to race. Nanaj had just described some awful scenes.</p>

    <p>Since Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s government monitored most international phone calls within Syria, my nanaj could not explicitly tell me any bad news or her worries. Any kind of criticism &ndash; even in obscure forms &ndash; associated with the Assad government would generate fines, threats or arrests. Nanaj and I had to resort to a different set of words to describe the atrocities happening on Damascene streets. We came up with these code words during my yearly visits to Damascus prior to the civil war.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Music playing&rdquo; meant nearby bombings. The reference to ripe tomatoes meant that the food prices had dramatically risen. &quot;Neighbors dropping by&quot; meant that Syria's streets were riddled with intelligence officers &ndash; known locally as the Mukhabarat &ndash; watching pedestrians&rsquo; every move.</p>

    <p>After this description, nanaj did not describe any more bad scenes or news. She sounded like she was in good health and that she was able to afford the necessary items for her day-to-day living.</p>

    <p>Everything seemed to be OK for the next few months. One year later, following the increasing number of bombings and gunshots as well as the imposition of arbitrary curfews, my nanaj decided that enough was enough &ndash; it was time to escape the dangerous city that had thus far been her lifelong home.</p>

        <h2>Leaving</h2>

            <p>Nanaj declared asylum in Montreal about six months ago. There, she had a support system: My aunt, uncle and cousins have lived there for many years. This past spring break, I got the chance to visit nanaj in Montreal&rsquo;s suburbs and listen to her accounts face to face. </p>

            <p>During my first morning with nanaj, she showered me with her morning blessings and jokes, raised the TV&rsquo;s volume to fill the room with Arabic news surrounding Syria and concocted the greatest Syrian breakfast anyone could ask for: za&rsquo;atar, hummus, olives, halloumi cheese, labneh and tea &ndash; lots of tea.</p>

            <p>Inevitably, the topic about my nanaj escaping Damascus surfaced. That was nanaj&rsquo;s first opportunity to describe to her grandson her experience of running away from her only home.</p>

            <p>Nanaj said it took her a long time to decide to leave for good.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I was lucky to leave early enough,&rdquo; she said.</p>
    <img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/05/prime.refugee.photo3_.jpg">

    <p>My grandmother&rsquo;s current studio apartment in Montreal is situated across the street from a pizzeria, a dollar store and an elementary school. She has now found comfort in the familiarity of the area.</p>

            <p>Nanaj was referring to her plans from five years ago, when she applied for a visitor&rsquo;s visa to Canada with hopes of visiting her family in Montreal for a few months. One year later, her visa was approved. After a few months, her plane departed for Canada. The Syrian civil war was in progress at that time, but today&rsquo;s Syrian refugee crisis had not yet materialized.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Nowadays, there is more attention on Syrian refugees, and not all of it is good. Based off of what I see on TV, many countries and people around the world have not been friendly to them,&rdquo; nanaj said.</p>

            <p>Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, Damascus has been one of the safest cities in Syria. In absolute terms, however, life in the city was still unbearable for many, including my grandmother.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Before I left, the bombs got louder and louder every day. They were getting closer to my house,&rdquo; nanaj said.</p>

            <p>Even before the Syrian civil war, Damascus transformed from a convivial city into a city of fear because of the increasing presence of security personnel, military vehicles and government censorship of public spaces. An authoritarian government, initiated by former President Hafez al-Assad, facilitated totalitarian impositions across Syrian society.</p>

        <h2>A new home</h2>

            <p>Nanaj landed in Montreal on a wintery afternoon. At the airport, she quickly retrieved her luggage and hurried toward the airport&rsquo;s arrival lobby. She did not care about anything else; she simply wanted to make it to her family safe and sound.</p>

            <p>Nanaj walked outside Montr&eacute;al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport to wait for her daughter &ndash; my aunt &ndash; to pick her up. The cold of Canada&rsquo;s winter, characterized by leafless trees, frosted cars and icy sidewalks, struck my grandmother in the face.</p>

      <div id="container_4" class="content_container regular_content">
        <h2>A changing political landscape</h2>

            <p>About half a year after nanaj's arrival in Canada, Stephen Harper, Canada&rsquo;s former prime minister, was replaced by the more left-leaning Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Like his father, Justin Trudeau pledged better treatment of refugees relative to his predecessor.</p>

            <p>When nanaj realized what was supposed to be an extended visit for pleasure had turned into a visit for life as Syria continued to crumble into war, financial assistance from Trudeau&rsquo;s government helped her relocate to her current studio apartment.</p>

            <p>Upon Nanaj&rsquo;s arrival to Canada in early 2015, Harper was prime minister of Canada. Harper faced a smaller demand from Syrian refugees wishing to live in Canada, yet he obtained a harsh reputation against immigration after he proposed criteria &ndash; known as areas of focus &ndash; that would favor granting immigration only to certain refugees based off of specific skills, such as fluency in English and/or French. At a glance, nanaj would have not fulfilled such criteria.</p>

            <p>In Trudeau&rsquo;s first few weeks as prime minister, however, he announced the Canadian government&rsquo;s pledge to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees. Since the pledge, nanaj is one of more than 26,000 Syrian refugees who now call Canada home.</p>

            <p>Under Trudeau's administration, Canadian institutions garnered support from the United Nations and Canadian citizens to institutionalize services for Syrian refugees within its borders. The World University Service of Canada, for instance, is spearheading a ballot measure among Canadian universities' student governments to help house more Syrian refugee students in Canada.</p>

            <p>Ishimwe Robbie, a Rwandan student at Montreal&rsquo;s McGill University who works for the World University Service of Canada, said he is leading one such referendum that would charge McGill students $3 per semester to support scholarships for Syrian refugees enrolling in the university.</p>

            <p>As of April 30, the university voted yes on the referendum that Robbie advocated for. About 10 Syrian refugee students will be sponsored for McGill degree programs starting next year.</p>

            <h2>Volunteering in Montreal</h2>

            <p>As I woke up in nanaj&rsquo;s apartment one morning, my cellphone screen shone brightly with a Facebook notification reminding me about a fundraising event that would take place at one of McGill&rsquo;s dormitories. The host of the event was a group I had never heard of before: Students for Syria. </p>

            <p>Nanaj knew I had signed up to attend that event. She shooed me off, and I soon found myself walking through Canadian snow toward the Villa-Maria train station in order to meet a group of people from Students for Syria.</p>

            <p>Comprised of first- and second-year McGill students, Students for Syria is an organization that developed one of Canada&rsquo;s first few Syrian refugee tutoring programs. Through its work, refugees like my nanaj can use the tutoring to help understand Canadian culture, the English language and Canadian bureaucracy.</p>

            <p>I arrived at the designated dormitory lounge early and was met by large oil paintings of notable McGill personalities, a student cellist setting the lounge&rsquo;s vibe, the smell of candle wax and Victorian furniture. This was nothing like UCLA&rsquo;s Rieber Fireside lounges.</p>

            <p>I sought out the organizers to ask how the organization came to be and how they were pulling it all off.</p>

            <p>Anton Zyngier, a first-year student and founder of Students for Syria, said the group first started through a freshmen-only project facilitated by McGill faculty.</p>

            <p>At first, Zyngier&rsquo;s group thought about solving problems associated with gentrification or homelessness. When some of the group members shared their reactions to a viral photograph of Aylan Kurdi &ndash; a Syrian toddler whose dead body washed up on Turkey&rsquo;s shores &ndash; the group concluded that it wanted to work on Syrian social issues.</p>

            <p>Zyngier said the idea of the tutoring program gained traction after the group discovered a dilemma in the Al Salam School, an educational institution for refugee children in Turkey. The school was losing its volunteer Test of English as a Foreign Language teachers. If nothing were to be done about the departure of these teachers, there would be no resources for college-bound refugees applying to North American universities. There would, essentially, be a TOEFL vacuum.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;So our group ended up thinking, &lsquo;Why not fill in this vacuum?&rsquo;&rdquo; Zyngier said.</p>

            <p>Most of the Syrian students taking part in the tutoring program are Skyping McGill students like Zyngier from various locations in Turkey. Zyngier added that one of the students in the program Skypes from Syria.</p>

                    <h2>A different view</h2>

                    <p>One of the attendees at the Students for Syria kickoff struck me with a comment that summarized the thoughts that possessed me upon returning to Los Angeles. </p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It looks like people barely know how to help in Los Angeles. I do not hear much about what they&rsquo;re doing about world affairs over there,&rdquo; said Tony Mistak, a student at McGill. &ldquo;Angels help people, right?&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Not only does UCLA have fewer institutions dedicated to helping Syrian refugees, but most of the student body also does not possess the enthusiasm to address the Syrian refugee crisis to its fullest capability.</p>

                    <p>Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is the executive director of the Tiyya Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing basic necessities for refugees in the greater Los Angeles area. She was at UCLA as a panelist May 10.</p>

             <h2>Flying home and back again</h2>

            <p>I woke up groggy-eyed. It was 5 a.m., and my flight back to Los Angeles from Montreal was set to depart in three hours. The sun was not up yet, and Montreal&rsquo;s cold morning air preserved snowflakes across nanaj&rsquo;s apartment windows. Nanaj woke up with ease and prepared the last great breakfast I would have in her company &ndash; with lots of tea involved, of course. Nanaj and I exchanged laughs and sleepy smiles. Surprisingly, she was not too sad about my departure.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like in Damascus, Jodutt, where I cried each time you left following your visits,&rdquo; nanaj said. &ldquo;In Damascus, I worried if I would ever see you again. I worried that you would not come by for years at a time. Now, you are a grown man with the ability to come here anytime you want. I&rsquo;ll be around for you any time and any day &ndash; and knowing you, I&rsquo;ll see you very soon.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>It was funny &ndash; I was more sad to leave nanaj than she was to see me leaving. Nonetheless, I heeded her words.</p>

            <p>I aim to visit her again soon.</p>
